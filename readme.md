## 🧐 About <a name = "about"></a>
Aruuz Gah is a web application featuring a modern responsive UI that can analyse the meter of Urdu couplets, pinpoint errors and suggest fixes for lines that do not conform to a standard meter. Aruuz refers to the system of scansion for Urdu and Persian poetry. It uses a self-devised binary encoding to represent the stresses of individual letters. The algorithm has been scrupulously crafted paying special attention to the needs and oft-repeated mistakes of beginners in mind.

## 🏁 Getting Started <a name = "getting_started"></a>
Just clone the project and open index.html in a browser.

## 🎈 Usage <a name="usage"></a>
If you want to locally run the system I'll suggest downloading the [backend](https://github.com/Chashm-e-Afreen/aruuz-gah-backend/) too. Then you could just run the go binary and head over to the frontend localhost and use the programme like you do online. Using the programme only requires you to enter text in the given textbox and it would generate the appropriate ouptut once you click the button underneath the textarea.
